    },
    {
      "question": "Why does light bend when it enters a different medium at an angle?",
      "options": [
        "Because it speeds up in the new medium.",
        "Because it slows down in the new medium, and one part of the wavefront enters before the other.",

      ],
      "answer": "When it strikes the interface along the normal (angle of incidence is 0 degrees).",
      "explanation": "If the wavefront enters the new medium squarely, all parts of it change speed simultaneously, so there's no pivoting effect."

      "options": [
        "No, it has units of m/s.",

      ],
      "answer": "Approximately 1.0; it allows simplifying Snell's Law to $n_{glass} = \\sin\\theta_{air} / \\sin\\theta_{glass}$.",
      "explanation": "Approximating $n_{air}$ as 1 essentially treats air as a vacuum for practical purposes in many experiments."
    },
    {
      "question": "Explain the concept of optical density in relation to refractive index.",
      "options": [
        "Optical density is the same as physical mass density.",
        "Higher optical density means light travels faster and bends less.",
        "Optical density measures a medium's ability to slow light; higher 'n' means optically denser and more bending.",
        "It relates to the transparency of a material, not light bending."
      ],
      "answer": "Optical density measures a medium's ability to slow light; higher 'n' means optically denser and more bending.",
      "explanation": "It's about how light interacts with the medium, not necessarily how heavy it is."

      ],
      "answer": "The angle of incidence for 90-degree refraction; no, not directly for primary measurement.",
      "explanation": "The experiment focuses on transmission, not total internal reflection, although critical angle is related to the refractive index."

      ],
      "answer": "Wavelength decreases, frequency remains constant, speed decreases.",
      "explanation": "Frequency is determined by the source, so it doesn't change; thus, wavelength must change with speed."
