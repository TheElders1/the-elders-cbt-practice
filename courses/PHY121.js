    { "question": "In a step-up transformer?", "options": ["Voltage increases, current decreases", "Voltage decreases, current increases", "Both voltage and current increase", "Both voltage and current decrease"], "answer": "Voltage increases, current decreases", "explanation": "In an ideal step-up transformer, voltage increases while current decreases proportionally to conserve power (P = VI)." },
    { "question": "The efficiency of a real transformer is less than 100% due to?", "options": ["Core losses only", "Copper losses only", "Both core and copper losses", "Voltage regulation"], "answer": "Both core and copper losses", "explanation": "Real transformers have losses due to resistance in windings (copper losses) and hysteresis/eddy currents in the core (core losses)." },
    { "question": "Motional EMF is induced when?", "options": ["A conductor moves in a magnetic field", "Current changes in a circuit", "Voltage is applied to a circuit", "Temperature changes"], "answer": "A conductor moves in a magnetic field", "explanation": "Motional EMF is induced when a conductor moves through a magnetic field, given by ε = BLv for a rod of length L moving with velocity v." },
    { "question": "The direction of induced current can be found using?", "options": ["Right-hand rule only", "Left-hand rule only", "Lenz's Law", "Ohm's Law"], "answer": "Lenz's Law", "explanation": "Lenz's Law determines the direction of induced current: it flows in a direction to oppose the change in magnetic flux that caused it." }
